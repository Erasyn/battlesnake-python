# Strategy 

Never hit walls.
Never trap yourself.
aka flood fill and never go into a smaller area than you are in

If length is less than 8: 
grab closet food until long enough

If closest to food,
move towards it and circle it (head to tail in 8 surrounding)
until less than 30 health 

If not closest to any food, 
move to empty part of the board and wait
